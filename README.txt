# UNIX_Scripts


A collection of UNIX Shell Scripts I wrote during my university studies.


This zip file contains three separate projects. 
They are as follows:


- File Copier;

- Denied User Double Login Checker; and

- List Viewer and Editor.


Each project contains a UNIX shell script file (*.sh), and some contain supporting text files on top of this script file.
